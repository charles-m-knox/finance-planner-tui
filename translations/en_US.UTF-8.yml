  You have started this application in keyboard echo mode. If you choose to continue, all of your key presses will be shown in the bottom left status bar. You can press Escape or Ctrl+C at any time to quit.

  These keyboard shortcuts are directly to be entered into your configuration for customization as shown, such as 'Rune[R[]'. If you wish to later remap the Escape key, use the string 'Esc', and for Ctrl+C, use the string 'Ctrl+C' in your configuration. Note that when in keyboard echoing mode, Ctrl+C and Escape are permanently mapped and cannot be changed.

  This was triggered by passing the -kb flag to this application on startup."

  [lightgreen::b]General information[-:-:-:-]

  The purpose of this application is to allow you to define recurring bills
  and income ([gold]transactions[-]), and then get a fairly accurate prediction
  of where your money will be using the [#8899dd]Results[white] page.

  [lightgreen::b]Profiles[-:-:-:-]

  Profiles are shown on the left-hand side of the [#8899dd]Profiles & Transactions[white] page.

  - You may need to use the <tab> key to get to them.
  - You can duplicate and rename profiles.
  - [gold]Each profile must have a unique name.[-] Duplicate names will be refused.

  You can create multiple [#8899dd]profiles[-] to fulfill any purpose, such as:

  - modeling a change in your financial plans (removing subscriptions,
    hypotheticals, etc)
  - adding multiple family members

  [lightgreen::b]Transactions[-:-:-:-]

  A [#8899dd]transaction[-] is a recurring expense or income:

  - If the transaction earns money, it is prefixed with a [lightgreen]+[-] (plus) sign.
  - All transactions are assumed to be negative by default.

  Each transaction has the following fields:

  - [::b]Amount[-]:    This is a positive or negative value as described above.
  - [::b]Active[-]:    This is a boolean value that determines whether the transaction should
              be included in calculations. This is useful for temporarily making
              changes without destroying anything.
  - [::b]Name[-]:      This is the human-readable name of the transaction for your eyes.
  - [::b]Frequency[-]: Transactions can occur [#8899dd]MONTHLY[-], [lightgreen]WEEKLY[-], or [gold]YEARLY.
              [-]This value must be exactly one of those three strings, but an auto-
              complete is provided to make it quicker.
  - [::b]Interval[-]:  The transaction occurs every [#8899dd]<interval>[white] WEEKS/MONTHS/YEARS.
  - [::b]<[-]Weekday>: The transaction only occurs on the checked days of the week, and
              will not occur if the defined recurrence pattern does not land on
              one of these days.
  - [::b]Starts[-]:    This is the starting date for the transaction's recurrence pattern.
              It is defined as [#8899dd]YYYY[white]-[lightgreen]MM[white]-[gold]DD[white].

              For simplicity when working with dates at the end of the month,
              you may want to consider putting setting the day value to 28, as
              some recurrence patterns may skip a 31.

              Months range from [#8899dd]1-12[white], and days range from [#8899dd]1-31[white].
              Years must be any positive value, and can be 0.
  - [::b]Ends[-]:      This is the last acceptable date for recurrence. Behavior is the
              exact same as the Starts field.
  - [::b]Note[-]:      A human-readable field for you to put arbitrary notes in.

  [lightgreen::b]Results[-:-:-:-]

  The results page allows you to see a projection of your finances into the
  future. It shows the following:

  - A form on the left containing start & end dates, and the starting balance
    for the projection to start with
  - A table containing one day per row, with each of the transactions that
    occurred on that day, as well as other numbers such as the total expenses,
    running balance since the first day of the projection, etc.

  The same hotkey that opens the results page can be pressed multiple times to
  re-submit the results form and will also show some useful statistics about
  your finances.

  [lightgreen::b]Keyboard Shortcuts: Current & Default[-:-:-:-]

  Custom keybindings are shown in [gold::b]gold[-:-:-:-]:
  {{ range $k, $v := .CombinedKeybindings }}
  - [::b]{{ $k -}}[-:-:-:-]: {{ range $v -}}{{- . }} {{ end -}}
  {{ end }}

  [lightgreen::b]Keyboard Shortcuts: All Actions Explained[-:-:-:-]
  {{ range $k, $v := .Explanations }}
  - [::b]{{ $k -}}[-:-:-:-]: {{ $v }}
  {{- end }}

  [lightgreen::b]Keyboard Shortcuts: All Actions' Mappings[-:-:-:-]

  For the sake of debugging any custom configuration changes you've made, actions
  and all of the ways they can be executed are shown below. Custom bindings are
  shown in [gold]gold[-], and bindings that are used as part of a chain of actions
  are shown in [#aaffee]a light blue color[-].
  {{ range $k, $v := .CombinedActions }}
  - [::b]{{ $k -}}[-:-:-:-]: {{ range $v -}}{{- . }} {{ end -}}
  {{ end }}

  [lightgreen::b]Keyboard Shortcuts: How to configure[-:-:-:-]

  Keyboard shortcuts can be bound to [::b]actions[-:-:-:-]. In your config.yml file,
  they can be specified with a top-level "keybindings" object, as shown in this
  example:

    ---
    keybindings:
      "Ctrl+X":
        - quit
      "Ctrl+V":
        - pagedown
      "Alt+V":
        - pageup
      "Rune[r]":
        - results

  Not all keyboard combinations will be actionable due to limitations of
  terminal emulators. To figure out which keybindings are acceptable, run this
  program with the [::b]"-kb"[-:-:-:-] flag to enter keyboard echo mode (more info will be
  given on startup). [::b]To unset a key, set its action value to 'none'[-:-:-:-].

  Astute readers will also note that more than one action can be provided per
  keybinding. For example, you may want to trigger multiple add actions at the
  same time by just pressing one set of keys. [yellow]You should be warned[-], however, that
  the number of permutations granted by chaining actions is massive, and can lead
  to completely untested scenarios, so expect bugs when using more than 1 action
  per key binding.

# <tab>/<shift+tab>: cycle back and forth between panels/controls where
# appropriate

# <esc>: deselects the last selected mark, and then deselects the last
# selected items, then un-focuses panes until eventually exiting the application
# entirely

# <ctrl+s>: saves to config.yml in the current directory

# <ctrl+i>: shows statistics in the Results page's bottom text pane

# [lightgreen::b]Transactions page:[-:-:-:-]

# <space>: select the current transaction
# <ctrl+space>: toggle multi-select from the last previously selected item
# <>
